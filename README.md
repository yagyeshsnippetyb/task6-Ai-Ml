 Objective
To implement and understand the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using a custom cricketers dataset and classify players as Batsman (1) or Non-Batsman (0) based on their performance data.

Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Dataset
A custom dataset of 10 Indian cricketers with the following fields:

Player: Name of the player

Runs: Total career runs

Matches: Total matches played

Is_Batsman: Target class (1 for batsman, 0 for non-batsman)

âš™Features Used
Runs

Matches

Model
Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
